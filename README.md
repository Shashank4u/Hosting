# What is Hosting?

**Hosting** is the service that allows individuals or organizations to make their websites or applications accessible on the internet. When you build a website, it consists of files (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) that need to be stored somewhere so users can access them online. Hosting providers offer this storage space on servers that are always connected to the internet.
